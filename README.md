## Normalizing Job Titles process

Provided with a list of ideal (normalized) job titles, create a class that implements a process that returns the best match when provided with an
input string.
Concretely, given a normalized job titles list of â€œArchitect", "Software engineer", "Quantity surveyor", and "Accountant", write a process that
returns the normalized result for the input.
